### OVERVIEW  
*Social media* can be defined as an array of networked, technologically-mediated practices of symbolic communication, structured by economic and political forces that both inflect and are inflected by social and cultural identities.

What is *social media theory*?  
What does it mean to *theorize* social media?
Why do we need social media theory at all?

To *theorize* something involves a number of processes:
- How do we define the phenomenon or object of study itself? How does it differ from previous or other related phenomena?
- How are we to account for it? Why did it happen/is it happening now rather than at some other time? What are its conditions of possibility?
- What is its relation to larger areas of society? What are its implications for those areas?
- How are we to evaluate it, in terms of its implications (political, economic, social, ethical, legal, environmental, aesthetic)? What are its possibilities and limits, its progressive and oppressive aspects? How can we change it for the better?

In practice these processes involve the development of analytical frameworks or models comprising particular concepts that are useful for identifying and analyzing key dimensions of the phenomenon/object in question. These frameworks and concepts typically draw from existing ones in different fields of study, but typically involve the proposal of new frameworks and concepts specific to the field in question.

We begin by defining the object itself: what exactly do we mean by the term *social media*? Haven't *media* - whether in the ancient or modern sense - always already been *social*? How do *social media* platforms differ from *social networking* platforms? What is a *platform* anyway, and how does it differ from a *medium*?  

### OBJECTIVES  
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- analyze technologies past, present, and imagined
- describe the ways in which technologies shape our world the ways in which we shape those technologies
- explain how social media is a result of the intersection between technologies and existing human communication dynamics
- discuss how theory of technology and social media can improve the vocational outlook of a student
- play a productive role in and even facilitate conversations that tease out the relationships between values and technology.  
- through the skills you will refine in writing your research papers, clearly explain how a specific technology shapes the social world that we live in.

### ASSIGNMENT SCHEDULE

This schedule is _subject _to _change_. Any changes to the reading materials will be announced in class and changed on Blackboard.

Readings from the course book are in bold. Other readings are *starred where they appear in the schedule of assignments below, and will be available on Blackboard.

You must read all the readings and discussion boards for the week *before Friday evening, as your discussion board overviews and questions are due Friday evening on the respective Blackboard discussion boards.

Class Rules and Grading Policies

Classroom Expectations

You are required to use Blackboard during class. Course materials, reading assignments, due dates and outlines are posted on Blackboard and may be updated weekly: this means that assigned readings, assignments and due dates _may _change. You are responsible for reading any course announcements that are posted on Blackboard. In addition, you may have to complete assignments or upload documents to Blackboard.

This class, while online, is a safe space from racist, sexist and homophobic speech. Don’t do it. If you do use hate speech in any forum associated with the class you will be subject to removal from class and possibly University disciplinary action. Keep it clean, polite and respectful on class time.

If you’re unsure, ask me before you do it, say it, copy it, or take it.

Grades

Grades will be based one midterm and one final exam, one term project and presentation, and class participation.

Midterm Project Description 25%

Term Project and Presentation* (graded across semester) 50% Participation on Class Discussion Boards 25%

*see below for specific breakdown of points within this category

Assignments

*By the end of every Friday evening, you will have done one of the following:- posted an overview and set of questions regarding the readings on the discussion board for the weekly readings

submitted at least one response to at least one classmate on their question

It’s very important that you make sure you are thinking about your readings and responses as soon as possible, and I have posted video commentaries on the readings in the Course Documents -> Online Videos sections. Please make sure you do the readings and videos as soon as possible.

The term project:

In week 2 you will submit a one-page project proposal, using the proposal template I’ll provide on Blackboard, on a topic of interest to you. This will be worth 5% of your final grade.

Do _not submit a proposal without discussing it with me first. I will provide you with suggestions for research and development, along with helping you refine your topic and project deliverable. There is a discussion board already available for you to submit ideas and discuss this with us so all of us can talk about your idea. It’s a great way to show the class what you enjoy, and to let all of us contribute to your excellence.

Deliverables can include scholarly research papers, fieldwork reports, media creations, app/software design, or other things in consultation with me.

Use your imagination and don’t be boring.

In week 4 you will submit a project progress report. This will focus on what you’ve done to meet the goals you set out in your proposal and what you need to do to complete successfully. This will be worth 5% of your final grade.

In week 7 you will deliver a video and audio presentation on your project. This will address what your topic was, why you chose it, why it should matter to your audience, what you did to investigate it, and what you concluded. This

will be worth 5% of your final grade.

To do this in PowerPoint: There should be a menu called “Slide Show.” On this menu, there’s a choice called “Slide transition (or just Transitions) . . . ” When you select it, you’ll see options for advancing the slide. Clear the check box beside “On Mouse Click,” and put (for example) “20″ in the box: “Automatically after  	 seconds.”

Final presentations are hard. Rehearse, and then rehearse a lot more. I will book a time for rehearsals the week before presentation day. Attendance will be optional but strongly encouraged.

In week 7 you will also submit your paper. This will be worth 20% of your final grade.

The written questions:

In the weeks specified on the schedule (pay careful attention!):

By the end of the day on Friday each week post one substantive* question or comment related to any of the readings for the following week. You are also required to comment on the work done by your fellow students.

*See “Reading Questions & Responses” below for detail on what a “substantive” question is and how to write a good one.

The question assignment is designed to do several things.

It shows what’s interesting to all of you: are there particular points or issues that consistently draw the class’s attention?

It also highlights things people might not have understood, or would like to see expressed more clearly during our class sessions.

It also helps us all get to know _you better – are you the one who always asks about economics, or politics, or pop culture?

Reading questions and responses:

A _bad_ question will be superficial, like a grade-school pop quiz question: “How does the author define X?” “How many copies of _Halo _Reach were sold last year?” Bad questions have answers in the material or are stock questions that could be applied to anything, without thought. “Isn’t this bad for kids?”

A _fine question asks for explanation or clarification: “Does Huizinga mean that games played for money aren’t games at all, or that they somehow stop being games when people get paid?”

A _great question links the reading to something else: “How does Huizinga’s attitude towards being paid to play relate to the role of amateurism in the Olympics and European aristocratic attitudes towards labor?”

A sentence or two is fine. You won’t get more credit for more words: conciseness and clarity are good things.

Below are two examples of questions from a previous class (on games studies) that represent “fine” and “great” questions.

_Example _#1:_

“I want to primarily focus on "Bow, N****". How has the internet and by extension online gaming allowed for individuals to express racial views that are considered socially unacceptable? Do these people truly feel this way or is there some sort of stimulus that promotes this usage online?”

_Example _#2_

“I'm talking about Alter Ego	The more options and choices that were

presented, the more unrealistic portions of the game seemed.	At what point do

we sacrifice realism in favor of control over the story? And at what point do we sacrifice control for the sake of realism? In my experience some of the best entertainment has come from finding the proper balance of these two, be it in a book, video game, or other form of media	It is this choice that leads to the

complexity and realism in life that I don't think video games are able to capture in its complexity and nuances.

GCE Learning Competencies

_Critical Thinking & Problem Solving_: The exam and term project formats are designed to confront students with a case drawn from current events in order to demonstrate their ability to apply theories, diagnose problems, and suggest solutions, both in a real-time, in-class exercise and over the course of the term in a more deliberative manner. In-class discussion focuses on students’ developing and defending personal views on key issues based upon evidence and theoretical frames.

_Communication: Students are encouraged to develop strengths in both written and oral communication, both deliberative and spontaneous, while the grading rubric recognizes that students have different strengths and comfort levels across media of expression. The format of the final presentation places a premium on conciseness, mastery of the material to be presented, and audience impact.

_Ethical Decision Making:_ This course examines the ethical underpinnings of technology design and use. It actively encourages students to discern and critique the ethical components of technology and to assert their own ethical values in technological analysis. The exams in particular call upon students to articulate an ethical and theoretical underpinning for their diagnoses of current problems and advocacy of solutions to those problems.

_Global _Awareness_: This course addresses the impact of technologies at the global scale, introduces concepts of global technological governance, and provides a range of readings and guest speakers from outside the US.

_Civic Engagement:_ This course does not call upon students to demonstrate civic engagement. Rather, it provides tools of critical thinking, ability to recognize global and local impacts, and the articulation of personal political lenses based upon

theoretical frameworks and data analysis, in order to empower students with the tools for informed and effective engagement with the impacts of technologies at local, national, and global levels.

### LATE POLICY

Assignments that are late will lose 1/2 of a grade per day, beginning at the end of class and including weekends and holidays. This means that a paper, which would have received an A if it was on time, will receive a B+ the next day, B- for two days late, and so on. Time management, preparation for our meetings, and timely submission of your work comprise a significant dimension of your professionalism. As such, your work must be completed by the beginning of class on the day it is due. If you have a serious problem that makes punctual submission impossible, you must discuss this matter with me before the due date so that we can make alternative arrangements. Because you are given plenty of time to complete your work, and major due dates are given to you well in advance, last minute problems should not preclude handing in assignments on time.

### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
The University “Academic Integrity” policy can be found online at [http:// www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/office-of-student-conductmediation-education/academic-integrity/.](http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/office-of-student-conduct-mediation-education/academic-integrity/) Students are expected to do their own work. Plagiarism and cheating are inexcusable. Any instance of plagiarism or cheating will automatically result in a zero on the assignment and may be reported the Office of Student and Academic Life at the discretion of the instructor.

Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to:
-   Using papers or work from another class.
-   Using another student's paper or work from any class.
-   Copying work or a paper from the Internet.
-   The egregious lack of citing sources or documenting research.
    
_If you're not clear on what is or is not plagiarism, ASK. The BEST case scenario if caught is a zero on that assignment, and ignorance of what does or does not count is not an excuse. That being said, I'm a strong supporter of_ _[Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Use) doctrine. Just attribute what you use--and, again, ASK if there's any doubt._

### AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA)
If you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, if you have emergency medical information to share with the instructor, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform the faculty member as soon as possible.

***

### TECHNOLOGY
At some point during the semester you will likely have a problem with technology. Your laptop will crash; your iPad battery will die; a recording you make will disappear; you will accidentally delete a file; the wireless will go down at a crucial time. These, however, are inevitabilities of life, not emergences. Technology problems are not excuses for unfinished or late work. Bad things may happen, but you can protect yourself by doing the following:

-   Plan ahead: A deadline is the last minute to turn in material. You can start—and finish—early, particularly if challenging resources are required, or you know it will be time consuming to finish this project.
    
-   Save work early and often: Think how much work you do in 10 minutes. I auto save every 2 minutes.
    
-   Make regular backups of files in a different location: Between Box, Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud, you have ample places to store and backup your materials. Use them.
    
-   Save drafts: When editing, set aside the original and work with a copy.
    
-   Practice safe computing: On your personal devices, install and use software to control viruses and malware.
