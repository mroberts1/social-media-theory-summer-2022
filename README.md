### DESCRIPTION
Syllabus - COMM 7018 - Social Media Theory - Summer 2021

Social media are powerful forces in the modern world, with much good linked to their implementation and integration into the social fabric. Nevertheless, technological development is not an unqualified blessing: Technologies may have negative effects for some people, at some times, in some circumstances. Some negative consequences are unanticipated, some are predictable, and some are intentional features of the design or implementation. But because social media technologies are rightly seen as indispensable for solving problems and improving the quality of life – particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic – societies invest in the design and development of technologies, hoping to shape and direct it.

This class will explore the relationship between technology and society to understand where technologies come from, how they are used within social media, and how they may be shaped to create better futures in society and industry. It is not a class where memorization is the primary goal. Instead we will develop skills for critical analysis and argument development. As we do this we will continually pose four important questions:

First, where do technologies come from and why do they work as they do? Technologies are human creations, and so their forms and uses reveal the interests and purposes of the people, institutions, and societies that build them.

Second, how do technologies shape our world? We will explore the variety of ways by which machines and techniques become embedded in society and thereby shape institutions, relationships, and values through their public face on social media.

Third, what kind of future do we want? Many of the articles we will read argue that certain values are of key importance to a just society, which challenges us to consider which values we should hold most dear and defend. This question is useful because it can help us better determine where our abilities and talents in the communications field may lead to our goals.

And fourth, how can we make decisions about technology that will get us to the future we want? Once we understand the role of technology in society and the world we want to build, we must develop strategies for getting us from here to there.

The basic structure of the course is, over the weekend we’ll read multiple scholarly articles on a topic. You’ll submit one question about the readings before the next week’s class. Online, we’ll discuss the readings carefully to build a solid understanding of a core concept, focusing on your questions. I’ll be uploading videos throughout the weeks to help you understand the readings and their intentions more, along with providing fodder for debate in the discussion boards. You’ll also develop a term project that will reflect your learning in and out of the class.

### OBJECTIVES  
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- analyze technologies past, present, and imagined
- describe the ways in which technologies shape our world the ways in which we shape those technologies
- explain how social media is a result of the intersection between technologies and existing human communication dynamics
- discuss how theory of technology and social media can improve the vocational outlook of a student
- play a productive role in and even facilitate conversations that tease out the relationships between values and technology
- through the skills you will refine in writing your research papers, clearly explain how a specific technology shapes the social world that we live in.

### COURSE MATERIALS

The core book for the course is Johnson, D. G., & Wetmore, J. M.  
(2009). _Technology and society: building our sociotechnical future_. (ISBN- 13: 978-0262600736; ISBN-10: 0262600730) It is generally available to order from booksellers and is also available in Kindle format.

Other readings will be made available on Blackboard, and will be located within their proper week on Blackboard.

### COURSE FORMAT
The course’s primary platform will be the Blackboard Learning Management System (LMS). Blackboard will be used for the course syllabus, reading assignments, lectures, discussion forums, written assignments, and messaging. These materials may be accessed either via a desktop or laptop computer or via a smartphone or other networked device. Since the course is conducted entirely online, all students are expected to have a cellphone with internet access and accounts on at least several of the major social media platforms.

Outside Blackboard, we will also be using a number of other communication tools and platforms, including Internet Relay Chat (IRC), RSS feeds, and/or social bookmarking sites. NB: although we will be referencing commercial social media platforms throughout the course, we will not be using these as part of the course itself.

### ASSIGNMENTS & EVALUATION

**1\. REST OF WORLD BLOG HOSTING (20%)**
Each week, two students in turn will be assigned as hosts on the Rest of World blog that will run throughout the course. Your role will be to select an article from the [Rest of World](https://restofworld.org/) global tech news site for reading and discussion by the class. You will write a short introduction to your chosen article and provide some additional comments and/or links to related resouces on the subject (250 words).

**2\. ALTERNATIVE ECOSYSTEMS (20%)**
Report on participant observation of an alternative social media community among one of those introduced in the course: Mastodon, Gemini, the digital garden community, tilde communities, or Scuttlebutt. This may be documented either by a written report or using the platform in question itself, e.g. by producing a digital garden or Gemini blog (gemlog) using [**flounder**](https://flounder.online/) or [**gemlog.blue**](https://gemlog.blue/). Runs throughout the semester.

**3\. CONNECT THE DOTS: FILM ESSAY (20%)**

### WEEKLY SCHEDULE

***
Week 1: Monday 16 May 2022

### PART I: LEARNING TO LABOR

### MOBILE SERVICES & THE PLATFORM ECONOMY
We begin by looking at the rapid emergence worldwide of what has become known as the platform economy: the proliferating services based on mobile apps such as Uber, Lyft, Doordash, and many others. The emergence of this “gig economy” has raised concerns not only about exploitative wages but also toxic and even dangerous work environments. We explore these issues via current and recent articles on the global tech news platform Rest of World.

Week 2: Monday 23 May 2022

### LIKE & SUBSCRIBE: CREATIVE LABOR & SOCIAL MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT  
This week explores the endlessly mutating and increasingly strange world of Social Media Entertainment (SME), including ASMR videos, Chinese _wanghong_ (influencers), Japanese VTubers, Korean _mukbang_ (binge-eating) channels, and TikTok. We consider the multi-channel networks (MCNs) that seek to extract capital from these mutations via advertising and commodity culture, and the standardization and ephemerality of creative content itself.

Week 6: Monday 20 June 2022

### MEME FACTORY: CULTURAL POLITICS  
The appropriation of meme culture by the white cultural supremacist movement in the run-up to and aftermath of the 2016 U.S. election has problematized assumptions about the effectiveness of memes as a tool of political critique. This week we consider the current state of meme culture and assess its potential as a platform for progressive political and social critique.

### LATE POLICY

Assignments that are late will lose 1/2 of a grade per day, beginning at the end of class and including weekends and holidays. This means that a paper, which would have received an A if it was on time, will receive a B+ the next day, B- for two days late, and so on. Time management, preparation for our meetings, and timely submission of your work comprise a significant dimension of your professionalism. As such, your work must be completed by the beginning of class on the day it is due. If you have a serious problem that makes punctual submission impossible, you must discuss this matter with me before the due date so that we can make alternative arrangements. Because you are given plenty of time to complete your work, and major due dates are given to you well in advance, last minute problems should not preclude handing in assignments on time.

### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
The University “Academic Integrity” policy can be found online at [http:// www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/office-of-student-conductmediation-education/academic-integrity/.](http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/office-of-student-conduct-mediation-education/academic-integrity/) Students are expected to do their own work. Plagiarism and cheating are inexcusable. Any instance of plagiarism or cheating will automatically result in a zero on the assignment and may be reported the Office of Student and Academic Life at the discretion of the instructor.

Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to:
-   Using papers or work from another class.
-   Using another student's paper or work from any class.
-   Copying work or a paper from the Internet.
-   The egregious lack of citing sources or documenting research.
    
_If you're not clear on what is or is not plagiarism, ASK. The BEST case scenario if caught is a zero on that assignment, and ignorance of what does or does not count is not an excuse. That being said, I'm a strong supporter of_ _[Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Use) doctrine. Just attribute what you use--and, again, ASK if there's any doubt._

### AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA)
If you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, if you have emergency medical information to share with the instructor, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform the faculty member as soon as possible.

***

### TECHNOLOGY
At some point during the semester you will likely have a problem with technology. Your laptop will crash; your iPad battery will die; a recording you make will disappear; you will accidentally delete a file; the wireless will go down at a crucial time. These, however, are inevitabilities of life, not emergences. Technology problems are not excuses for unfinished or late work. Bad things may happen, but you can protect yourself by doing the following:

-   Plan ahead: A deadline is the last minute to turn in material. You can start—and finish—early, particularly if challenging resources are required, or you know it will be time consuming to finish this project.
    
-   Save work early and often: Think how much work you do in 10 minutes. I auto save every 2 minutes.
    
-   Make regular backups of files in a different location: Between Box, Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud, you have ample places to store and backup your materials. Use them.
    
-   Save drafts: When editing, set aside the original and work with a copy.
    
-   Practice safe computing: On your personal devices, install and use software to control viruses and malware.
